# 🌸 MamaBloom – Your AI Companion for Motherhood

*A gentle, private space for new moms to talk, reflect, and feel supported.*

---

## 🚩 Problem

New mothers often struggle with emotional overload, isolation, anxiety, and the constant pressure to “do everything right.”
Professional mental-health support isn’t always available 24/7 — and many moms hesitate to share their feelings openly.

MamaBloom creates a safe, non-judgmental, always-available space for moms to talk, vent, reflect, and get comforting AI support.

## 💡 How MamaBloom Works

MamaBloom is a mobile-friendly AI chat companion designed specifically for new mothers.

1. Users create an account using **email/password** or **Google Sign-In**.
2. After login, they access a **warm, calm chat interface**.
3. The AI responds gently, offering emotional support, guidance, and reassurance.
4. All past conversations appear in **Chat History**, so moms can revisit insights.
5. Personal notes can be saved privately for reflection.
